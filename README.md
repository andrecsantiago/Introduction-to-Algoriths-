Introduction to algorithms
Invite every one of you new to the computer science subject to share with this learning experience over the reference book in algorithms, studying and putting in practice, the best way to learn. 
I also invite some experience folks to share some valuable lessons with us that are just getting started. 
One algorithm at a time from the book Introduction of Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. Time to learn, let's get started.
